        <h1 class= header>CHESTY PULLER</h1>
        <p>Lewis Burwell "Chesty" Puller (June 26, 1898 â€“ October 11, 1971) served as a United States Marine Corps officer. Beginning his career fighting guerillas in Haiti and Nicaragua as part of the Banana Wars, he later served with distinction in World War II and the Korean War as a senior officer. By the time of his retirement in 1955, he had reached the rank of lieutenant general.

            Puller is the most decorated Marine in American history. He is one of two United States servicemen to be awarded five Navy Crosses and one Army Distinguished Service Cross. Puller's six crosses are next in number to the seven times Eddie Rickenbacker received the nation's second-highest military award for valor.[1]
            
            Puller retired from the Marine Corps in 1955, after 37 years of service. He lived in Virginia and died in 1971, at age 73.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesty_Puller"> More info</a></p><br>
