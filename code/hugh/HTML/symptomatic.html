--- the idea behind this website / API is that people would be able to create a health profile ---
--- specific to them that would be compared to an "average healthy human" from the same demographic ---
--- this would allow people to take health and diagnosis into their own hands ---
--- and allow patients to share information that doctors ignore or do not know ---
--- such as the incredibly debilitating side effects of Cymbalta withdrawal. ---

this would go far beyond normal questionnaires and would seek to create averages of every aspect of human life
for health purposes the averages gathered would be the standards: family history, personal health history, 
surgeries, contagious diseases contracted, disorders, and any signficant health issues
in addition the app would support logging daily checkins for things like pain, abnormal symptoms, status of managed symptoms
psychological status, caloric intake, lab test results, vitamin supplements and expected vitamin levels in blood

ideally if used at a large scale this app will produce connections that other health records have not
Additionally people would easily be able to determine if something is "normal" with the app 
many people don't get treatment for chronic conditions because they don't even know the symptoms are abnormal
