    <div class="bodyText"><p>Belobog is a the name of a religious deity found in Slavic pagan cultures.  Belobog, "the white god" was locked in an eternal struggle with
        Chernobog, "the black god".  Slav's belief was that an eternal struggle existed between the two which played out annually.
        Belobog is indicative of the the season's spring and summer, and Chernobog indicative of fall and winter. Although scholars are certain
        Slavic tribes believed in the deity, the existence of Belobog is not confirmed in any religious text nor tale passed down from
        the ages. Belobog was known to take the form of an elderly man, who would proceed to guide lost souls from forests.</p></div>
