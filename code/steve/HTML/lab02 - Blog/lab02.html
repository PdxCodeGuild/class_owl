            <p>Many people think that history is a dull subject. Dull? Is it "dull" that Jesse James once got bitten on the forehead 
                by an ant, and at first it didn't seem like anything, but then the bite got worse and worse, 
                so he went to a doctor in town, and the secretary told him to wait, so he sat down and waited, 
                and waited, and waited, and waited, and then finally he got to see the doctor, 
                and the doctor put some salve on it? You call that dull?</p>

            <p>I bet when neanderthal kids would make a snowman, someone would always end up saying, 'Don't forget the thick, 
                heavy brows.' Then they would get all embarrassed because they remembered they had the big husky brows too, 
                and they'd get mad and eat the snowman.</p>

            <P>I think a good gift for the President would be a chocolate revolver. 
                And since he is so busy, you'd probably have to run up to him real quick and give it to him.</P>
